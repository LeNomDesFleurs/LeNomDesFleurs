I use dev to craft audio and visuals, I want my tools to be / make art ⚙️🖼️.

I'm mostly using the [🧃JUCE framework](juce.com) to make audio plugins, which is a form of tool that is widespread and easy to share.
But I'm also interested in other (often dawless) ways of making music.

There is much that hasn't been explored in the digital realm, especially for the interface .
I design UIs that are firsty _inspirative_ and secondly _usable_ or _practical_. 
Informed by research on parameter mapping, use of modular synth and general sound mangling.
